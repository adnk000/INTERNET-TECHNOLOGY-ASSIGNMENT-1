      <h1 class="sec-heading">Introduction to HTML</h1>
      HTML (<i>Hypertext Markup Language</i>) is used to create document on the
      <u><b>World Wide Web</b></u
      >. It is simply a collection of certain keywords called "Tags" that are
      helpful in writing document to be displayed using a browser on Internet.
      HTML was developed by <b>Tim Berners- Lee</b> in 1992.
